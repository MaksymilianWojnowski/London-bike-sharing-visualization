# London Bike Sharing Data Analysis
The "London Bike Sharing" project showcases a data-driven exploration into the dynamics of bike-sharing usage in London. Through an interactive Tableau dashboard, users can discover how environmental factors and time influence bike rental patterns

# Methodology

The analysis utilizes Python for data manipulation and cleaning, and Tableau for creating interactive visualizations that highlight key aspects of the data. Key processes include:

- Data extraction from the original ZIP file.
- Renaming of columns for better readability and consistency.
- Transformation of weather and season data from numerical codes to descriptive categories.

# Visualizations

The Tableau dashboard provides an interactive way to explore the dataset, with visualizations such as:

- Total Rides Counter
- Adjustable Moving Average Line Chart
- Temperature vs Wind Speed Heatmap
- Weather Conditions Tooltip Chart
- Hourly Rentals Tooltip Chart

These visualizations help to easily interpret complex data patterns and can be viewed by opening the .twb file in Tableau

# Key Findings

The analysis revealed:

- Peak rental hours coincide with commuting times.
- Favorable conditions for bike rentals include mild temperatures and low wind speeds.
- Rental frequency declines during adverse weather conditions.
